2 of my 4 hours trying to get Liberator to work.  I could do a GET, but I didn't figure 
out how to get the params of my JSON PUT request to come through.  My best guesses right now
are that they were were either encoded as a Bytestream on the body of the request, or they 
just weren't getting passed in from the front end at all.

 Anyways, I wanted to respect the time limits you guys assigned and just reached a point where it was just time to move on.
If I had this to do over again, I might try composure-api :)"]
